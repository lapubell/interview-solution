# interview-solution

When I do practice interviews for Code2040, I use this simple string translation challenge a lot. Here's the solution.

## The question

Can you transform the names in this block so that the left side of the arrow matches the right side?

```
mr jim jones       -> Mr. Jim Jones
James smith        -> James Smith
Ms Sally Smith     -> Ms. Sally Smith
MRS. KRISTIN BROWN -> Ms. Kristin Brown
Mister Tom Jones   -> Mr. Tom Jones
```
